# someweireapi
An Api to solve **riddles**, win **ERC20 tokens**, forge **ERC721 tokens** with random types and rarities, and trade them with decentralized **auctions**.

The API is a template, for a **decentralized riddle web game**. The goal is to solve riddles. Each riddle solved rewards an amount of ERC20 tokens, which are of 3 types, called **Weivellite**, **Weither** and **Weillenium**.

The player can then **forge** an ERC721 Token, named **Artifact**, with amounts of ERC20 tokens of the 3 types. The amounts and a **RNG** will determine the type and rarity of the Artifcact : **Common**, **Rare** and **Legendary** rarities, and **Technology**, **Art** and **Material** types.

The player can then sell artifacts for Weivellite, Weither and Weillenium Tokens, by creating **decentralized auction contracts**.
